This is a placeholder for the icon.png file.

Please replace this file with a 128x128 PNG image file named "icon.png" for your Home Assistant add-on.

You can use any Material Design Icon as your add-on icon. For example, you could use the image-filter icon:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mdi/svg/svg/image-filter.svg

Or create your own custom icon that represents the SVG to PNG conversion functionality.
